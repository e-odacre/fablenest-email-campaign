          Hi [First Name],<br/><br/>
          Spring is here, and so is a new chapter at Fable Nest.<br/><br/>
          We’ve been quietly crafting fresh scents, cozy textures, and thoughtful pieces to help you welcome the season in slow, beautiful ways.<br/><br/>
          From hand-poured floral candles to woven blankets in soft, earthy tones — everything is inspired by the stories this season tells.<br/><br/>
          <a href="https://fablenest.example.com/spring">🌸 Preview the Spring Collection »</a><br/><br/>
          With warmth,<br/>
          Evan from Fable Nest
